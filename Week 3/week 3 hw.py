"""
Import the bank_accounts.py (which is uploaded here as a .txt file, you'll have to rename it to .py) file and use the account_info list to generate a CSV file from the list of dictionaries.
There should be a header (the keys in the dict) and then the rest of the data.  One thing to add in for both the header and the in the data is the last_activity_date and then a formatted date in the data.
Call the file bank_account_info.csv.

BONUS:
At the end of writing the file print out, in a nice format, some statistics such as M-F ratio, average bank account value, max and min ages, how many people per state.

NOTE:  This can all be done in ONE loop.   Donâ€™t over complicate this!!  Without the bonus, it took me 7 lines of code!!
